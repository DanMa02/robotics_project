# FIRST EXPERIENCE 
## THE CHALLENGE
- Build our custom world
  - For the moment only one megablock in a table and the ur5 fixed on the table
- Create a custom script that recognize the object and estimate the position
- Build the motion control script in order to use the values generated by the CV 
- Try to position the UR5 and pick up the object
  
## LITTLE STEPS
- We can try to create simple world (e.g. one cube) and then increase the complexity
- Try to locate at first the obj, than publish the data in the console. In a second moment we can try to send these datas to the UR5
- Try at first to move the UR5 than use the processed data to move the UR5
  - Try to open and close the gripper
  - Try to move it over the block
