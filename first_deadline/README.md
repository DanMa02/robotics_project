# FIRST EXPERIENCE 
## THE CHALLENGE
- Build our custom world
  - For the moment only one megablock in a table and the ur5 fixed on the table
- Create a custom script that recognize the object and estimate the position
- Build the motion control script in order to use the values generated by the CV 
- Try to position the UR5 and pick up the object
  
## LITTLE STEPS
- We can try to create simple world (e.g. one cube) and then increase the complexity
- Try to locate at first the obj, than publish the data in the console. In a second moment we can try to send these datas to the UR5
- Try at first to move the UR5 than use the processed data to move the UR5
  - Try to open and close the gripper
  - Try to move it over the block
  - ...

## EXECUTION
Files can be find in the *script* folder, this is a little guide to explain how it works
### MOVEMENT
For the movement of the ur5, the topic */command* is subscribed by the **ros_impedance_controller**. Normally the file *params.py* has the field `control_type: position` but in order to use the controller we have to change this field into `control_type: torque`. So we know now that if we wanto to publish in the */command* topic we have to use the flag `torque` in order to use the **ros_impedance_controller**, instead if we want to don't change anything we have to publish in the */ur5/joint_group_pos_controller/command* and we will not use the **ros_impedance_controller**
  - If using `position` mode topic will be */ur5/joint_group_pos_controller/command*, we have to use the **Float64MultiArrays** msg that it's under the *std_msgs.msg*
  - If using `torque` mode topic will be */command*, we have to use the **JointState** msg that it's under the *sensor_msgs.msg*

In order to send joint messages with the last (4/11/22) version of locosim we have to append the gripper information in our msg.

To create the gripper manager at first import it and then use its contructor
```PYTHON
from base_controllers.components.gripper_manager import GripperManager
```
```PYTHON
self.gm = GripperManager(False, conf.robot_params['ur5']['dt'])
```
Then append the info 
```PYTHON
msg.data = np.append(self.q_des, self.gm.getDesGripperJoints())
```

Added the *keyPub.py* script, it use keyboard input to control the robot. The list of input is:

|MOTION|KEY|
|------|---|
|+0.5 first joint|q|
|-0.5 first joint|a|
|+0.5 second joint|w|
|-0.5 second joint|s|
|+0.5 third joint|e|
|-0.5 third joint|d|
|+0.5 fourth joint|r|
|-0.5 fourth joint|f|
|+0.5 fifth joint|t|
|-0.5 fifth joint|g|
|+0.5 sixth joint|y|
|-0.5 sixth joint|h|
|+5 gripper joint|o|
|-5 gripper joint|p|

The *mypublisher.py* script simulate a sin function, it works!

#### ISSUES
- On the *keyPub.py* the gripper doesn't work as intended
